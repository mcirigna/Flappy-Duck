# Flappy Duck
------------------

Description
-----------

This program is a remake of the mobile game Flappy Bird. The player controls a bird that navigates between obstacles to gain points.

Advanced Features
-----------------

Collisions: are used to detect the intersection between the pipe obstacles and the bird.

Physics: are used to simulate a gravitational force on the bird and to thrust the bird into the air when the player presses the jump control.

Bump Mapping: is used to make the ocean look more realistic.

-Marvin Cirignano: Worked on creating and texturing the scrolling skybox and ground and helped with game mechanics and display.

-Eddie Huang: Worked on pipe generation and significantly improved pipe design from closed cylinders to their current state, and implemented a moving bump map for the ocean. Worked on forest background.

-Wing Han So (Stella): Worked with scrolling backgroud for the horizontally background move while the game is running, and Marvin helped for the texturing. Worked with sun light and objects.

Instructions
-------------------

Runs using the same sequence of commands as the assignments. Double click host.bat to run the server, and using Chrome, navigate to localhost:8000.
