
# Flappy Duck
------------------

Description
-----------

This program is a remake of the mobile game Flappy Bird. The player controls a bird that navigates between obstacles to gain points.

Advanced Features
-----------------

Collisions: are used to detect the intersection between the pipe obstacles and the bird.

Physics: are used to simulate a gravitational force on the bird and to thrust the bird into the air when the player presses the jump control.

Bump Mapping: is used to make the ocean look more realistic.
